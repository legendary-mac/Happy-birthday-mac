Thank you myrth monke silki komito and kowann!! I miss staying awake till 2 am and 3 am just to join your trainings! My memories in the academy and LOK is definitely a huge chunk of my childhood. I wish things never changed back then. art bob lion when everyone was together. Every night was memoriable. Thank you for caring me! If i remember correctly.. the next training all of you stood together and said happy birthday to me. the whole map was colorful in disco light i think. Should have gave epilepsy warning. still it was memoriable and fun.

Cueniversity! small community of people. lots of fun. lots of giggles. I still blame the game for causing such a beautiful community into abandoned ruin. I wish i could talk to Aotoo and goloss one more time. I wish i could say goodbye. Although everyone disappeared one by one, and the time we were together was mere 10 months. the time was enough for us to voice chat with each other and play other various games! we watched horror animes together. It was fun. It should have never dissolved and disappeared. Nimzo goose charzi shrek crown counter aotoo and goloss for making my birthday even more memoriable! if only i knew.. that goloss would disappear tomorrow. #teammacsister #42Supremacy
